 in length and 600 to 1,200 millimetres (24 to 47 inches) in breadth that is typically wrapped around the waist, with one end draped over
 the shoulder, partly baring the midriff.It is traditionally worn in the countries of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal.
There are various styles of sari manufacture and draping, the most common being the Nivi style The sari is worn with a fitted bodice 
commonly called a choli (ravike or kuppasa in southern India, and cholo in Nepal) and a petticoat called ghagra, parkar, or ul-pavadai.
In the modern Indian subcontinent, the sari is considered a cultural icon.

<h4>Jeans</h4>
<p>
Jeans are a type of pants or trousers, typically made from denim or dungaree cloth. Often the term "jeans" refers to a particular style
 of trousers, called "blue jeans", which were invented by Jacob W. Davis in partnership with Levi Strauss & Co. in 1871 and patented by
 Jacob W. Davis and Levi Strauss on May 20, 1873. Prior to the Levi Strauss patented trousers, the term "blue jeans" had been long in use 
for various garments (including trousers, overalls, and coats), constructed from blue-colored denim.

<h5>Heels</h5>
<p>
High heels are a type of shoe in which the heel is significantly higher off the ground compared to the toes. High, or elevated, heels 
are anything over 3.5 cm and can be as much as 18 cm or more in the case of ballet boots. High heels make the wearer appear taller, 
accentuate the muscle tone in their legs and make their legs appear visibly longer.
