<h2>Shirt</h2>
<p>
A shirt is a cloth garment for the upper body (from the neck to the waist).Originally an undergarment worn exclusively by men, it has
 become, in American English, a catch-all term for a broad variety of upper-body garments and undergarments. In British English, a shirt 
is more specifically a garment with a collar, sleeves with cuffs, and a full vertical opening with buttons or snaps (North Americans would
 call that a "dress shirt", a specific type of collared shirt). A shirt can also be worn with a necktie under the shirt collar.

<h3>Oxford shoe<h3>
<p>
An Oxford shoe is characterized by shoelace eyelets tabs that are attached under the vamp,a feature termed "closed lacing".This contrasts
 with Derbys, or bluchers, which have shoelace eyelets attached to the top of the vamp.Originally, Oxfords were plain, formal shoes,
 made of leather, but they evolved into a range of styles suitable for formal, uniform, or casual wear. On the basis of function and the
 dictates of fashion, Oxfords are now made from a variety of materials, including calf leather, faux and genuine patent leather, suede,
 and canvas. They are normally black or brown, and may be plain or patterned (brogue).
