<h2>Welcome to fashion world</h2>
<p>
Fashion is a form of self-expression, at a particular period and place and in a specific context, of clothing, footwear,
lifestyle, accessories, makeup, hairstyle, and body posture. In its everyday use, the term implies a look defined by the
fashion industry as that which is trending. Everything that is considered fashion is available and popular by the fashion
system (industry and media).As noted by fashion scholar Susan Kaiser, everyone is forced to appear, that is, there is no unmediated 
way of being before others.Whether we want it or not, everyone appearing before another is evaluated by the dress, their attire.
This most commonly means how one looks, what colors, materials, and silhouette one wears on the body. Even if the garments are all 
the same, they will appear different; if the item is washed, folded, mended, or new.The term fashion is plagued by its many different uses,
 and by the unclear application of the concept. For example, the term connotes difference, but also sameness. It signifies the latest
 distinction, as well as the return of the old. While it may be defined by an insular and esteemed aesthetic elite, who make a look
 exclusive, this look is often using references from those excluded from making the distinction.
